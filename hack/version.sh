#    UPG_GIT_COMMIT - The git commit id corresponding to this
#          source code.
#    UPG_GIT_TREE_STATE - "clean" indicates no changes since the git commit id
#        "dirty" indicates source code changes after the git commit id
#        "archive" indicates the tree was produced by 'git archive'
#    UPG_GIT_VERSION - "vX.Y" used to indicate the last release version.
#    UPG_GIT_MAJOR - The major part of the version
#    UPG_GIT_MINOR - The minor component of the version

# Grovels through git to set a set of env variables.
#
# If UPG_GIT_VERSION_FILE, this function will load from that file instead of
# querying git.
